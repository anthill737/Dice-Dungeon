Now I realize how confusing the layout is. If you're reading this and you find coins, they're probably mine. Consider it a lucky find. -Retired Guard Hadley"

    {
      "text": "Prayer for Safe Travel: 'May the path be clear and the journey swift.' Traditional blessing recited by guards before patrol. Simple ritual. Morale booster more than anything. Old tradition from when the dungeon first opened. Still practiced by some of the older staff."
    },
    {
      "text": "Blessing of Safe Passage: 'Guide us straight and true.' Short prayer often carved into lintels above doorways. Architectural tradition from the builders. Similar carvings found throughout the older sections. Provides sense of continuity with the past."
    },
    {
      "text": "Rite of Remembrance: 'Honor those who came before.' Memorial service held monthly for guards who've retired or passed away. List of names read aloud. Dignified ceremony. Names engraved on memorial wall in the main hall. Good for morale to remember our history."
    },
    {
      "text": "Invocation of Protection: 'Shield us from harm, guide us from danger, bring us home safely.' Standard prayer recited at start of shift. Like a soldier's oath. Reminds everyone to watch out for each other. Simple but effective for team cohesion."
    },
    {
      "text": "Litany of Clarity: 'Grant us clear sight and clear mind.' Popular among scholars and researchers. Helps focus before long study sessions. Also used by guards for maintaining alertness during boring overnight shifts. Common enough to be almost a secular tradition now."
    },
    {
      "text": "Hymn of the Depths: 'From darkness to darkness, in darkness we work.' Sung by the old mining crews. Melancholy but honest about the working conditions. Tradition carried on by some of the veteran staff. Reminds us we're all in this together, working in the dark."
    },
    {
      "text": "Supplication for Mercy: 'We are small and weak before great forces. Remember our humanity.' Used in formal religious ceremonies. Humility prayer. Standard in most traditional faiths. Written in old language but translated versions are common."
    },
    {
      "text": "Chant of Unseeing: 'What we overlook holds no power over us.' Meditation mantra used by some guards to deal with stress. Philosophy being that overthinking dangers makes them worse. Focus on the work at hand, don't imagine problems that aren't there. Practical approach."
    },
    {
      "text": "Prayer of Last Resort: 'When all hope fails, when all paths close, when darkness falls, we call upon—' Text is damaged. Last line missing. Old prayer probably from the founding era. Academic interest only. Most guards prefer simpler, complete prayers."
    },
    {
      "text": "Devotional of the Endless Vigil: 'We watch, we guard, we maintain.' Motto of the Silent Watch - elite guard unit that handles restricted areas. They take vows of minimal speaking to maintain focus. Serious about security. Respected but considered a bit extreme by regular staff."
